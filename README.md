- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pak-Ameen
- 👀 I’m interested in d-tube error messages that go along with the system preventing me from posting a video.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to follow my disdain for Google and establish my life's first own video channel elsewhere.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate nowhere else.
- 📫 How to reach me: via pak_ameen@aol.com
